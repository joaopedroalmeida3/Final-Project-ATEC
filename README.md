# Final-Project-ATEC

Final course project made in "ATEC - Academia de formação", with the purpose to allow students to book driving lessons.
This project was made by a team of three members. Two team members were responsible to develop the laravel project and the laravel API, while the other team member was responsible to develop a mobile app in Xamarim. 
One of the main goals of this project was to prepare us to work like a team of programmers, where tasks should be distributed between team members, and to mainly prepare us for the labour market.

This repo only contains the laravel app.
